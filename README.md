# Project-Landing-Page

## This repository is for The Odin Project exercise named Project: Landing Page

> For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.

 Complete website: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png
